Understanding the Performance Scorecard üß©
The performance scorecard is a vital tool in our strategic arsenal. It tracks key metrics such as Revenue, Wins, Revenue per Win, Pipeline, Leads, and Pipeline per Lead. By comparing the current quarter (CQ) with the previous quarter (PQ), it provides a clear picture of our performance, highlighting both achievements and areas needing attention.

Extensive Data Compilation: Collected and organized sales data across various categories.
Performance Metrics Analysis: Created detailed Profit and Loss (P&L) reports and customer net sales performance reports.

Automation in Excel: Automated the entire process in Excel, significantly reducing the time required for data processing and reporting. This automation, inspired by Kunal Naik's principle of "automate more, earn more," has been a game-changer for our team.
